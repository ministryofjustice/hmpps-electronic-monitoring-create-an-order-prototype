        Fixed address
      </h1>

   

     <p>  A fixed address is the address the device wearer has registered as their home address. It can be temporary accommodation, an Approved Premises (AP), a fixed tenancy or a permanent address.</p> 

    <p>  A fixed address is required to process all monitoring orders apart from those that include Alcohol monitoring or where the device wearer is part of the Acquisitive Crime (AC) Project.</p>

  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">Warning</span>
   For all other orders do not raise the order until you have the device wearer's address. If the address isnâ€™t available at the time of release, probation will be responsible for the order.
