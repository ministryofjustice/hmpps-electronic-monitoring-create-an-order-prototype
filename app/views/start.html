       <p>This service does not yet allow you see and use information from other services such as Digital Prison Services (DPS) and Create and vary a licence.</p>

       <p>You will need to have and enter information about the device wearer and the monitoring requirements from the licence.</p>

       <p>To help plan installation you will be asked risk information about the device wearer. Answer questions based on what you know about the device wearers previous offence and behaviour. If you do not have this information you can ask Probation.</p>
